# Lab 3 - Grove Vibration Motor Experiment 
## Introduction
Vibration Motor as Digital output with busy wait PWM: this is a mini vibration motor suitable as a non-audible indicator. When the input is HIGH, the motor will vibrate just like your cell phone on silent mode. This simple application uses a DigitalOut port to buzz the vibration motor at intervals of 1 second. Anything less than 1 second and the motor will not engage properly. The vibration is accomplished via busy wait.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
- Grove Shield
